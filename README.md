# MultiThreading_LanguageBinding
This was done during a course at university, showing how to use multi-threading and language binding with c++ and python.

##Ex9
The files in ex9.x directories relate to pure multi-threading in C++. Ex9.2 also shows the use of condition variables and mutex variables. 
In this program we basically just fill a vector with numbers and remove them. We just allow 2 different threads to play with this idea.

##Ex10
In ex10 we use the program from ex9.2 and apply it to language binding using pybind. Using the python script we can call the c++ 
program from a python environment.
